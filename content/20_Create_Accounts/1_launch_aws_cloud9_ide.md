## Starting AWS Cloud9 IDE

AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools for popular programming languages and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) pre-installed so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your laptop for this workshop. 


**Cloud9 works best with Chrome or Firefox, not Safari. It cannot be used from a tablet.**

For this workshop we will be using `us-east-2` (All links in the lab instructions will be pointed to this region)

**:white_check_mark: Step-by-step Instructions**

1. From the AWS Management Console, Select **Services > Cloud9** under Developer Tools [Click here for deeplink to c9](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/product)

6. Select **Next step**.

7. Review the environment settings and select **Create environment**. It will take a couple of minutes for your Cloud9 environment to be provisioned and prepared.

## Setting up Cloud9 IDE

1. Once ready, your IDE will open to a welcome screen. Below that, you should see a terminal prompt. Close the Welcome tab and drag up the terminal window to give yourself more space to work in.

 "Add the Required IAM Role"

We will need to attach a Role to Cloud9 so we can have access to A

- Switch to the **AWS Console** (You can open the console from the "Team Dashboard")
- Under **Services**, select **EC2**
- Click **Running Instances**
- Select the instance named "aws-cloud9-..." by clicking the check box to the left of the name
- On **Actions** pull down, select **Instance Settings -> Attach/Replace IAM Role**
- In the **IAM role** pull down, select **TeamRoleInstanceProfile**
- To the right, click **Apply**




# Update IAM settings for your Workspace

- Return to your workspace and click the gear icon (in top right corner), or click to open a new tab and choose "Open Preferences"
- Select **AWS SETTINGS**
- Turn off **AWS managed temporary credentials**
- Close the Preferences tab
![Step 8](/images/getting_started/c9disableiam.png)

To ensure temporary credentials aren't already in place we will also remove
any existing credentials file:
```sh
rm -vf ${HOME}/.aws/credentials
```

```sh
echo "export AWS_REGION=us-east-1" | tee -a ~/.bash_profile
aws configure set default.region ${AWS_REGION}
aws configure get default.region
```

### Validate the IAM role

Use the [GetCallerIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-caller-identity.html) CLI command to validate that the Cloud9 IDE is using the correct IAM role.

Just run this to try it out yourself.

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

Here is a script that will validate you have the right role.

```
aws sts get-caller-identity --query Arn | grep TeamRole -q && echo "IAM role valid" || echo "IAM role NOT valid"
```

{{% notice warning %}}
If the IAM role is not valid, <span style="color: red;">**DO NOT PROCEED**</span>. Go back and confirm the steps on this page.
